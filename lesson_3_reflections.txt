When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working on a project with more than one person. When you are publishing your work for others to consume. When you care about having your work backed up remotely. When you need to access your work from another machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To avoid pulling in changes that could conflict too frequently and disrupt work on a local change. To be able to pull in changes from another branch when the remote version of a branch may not be the desired branch anymore. To avoid pulling in changes from others that could have broken the remote branch.
