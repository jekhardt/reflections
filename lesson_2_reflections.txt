What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git creates its files in the directory where git init was created. It needs to be done to create the tracking files that enable versioning the other non-git related files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area differs because it is what git sees as being includable in a commit. The working directory has the files in the filesystem regardless of whether they tracked by git. This is valuable to make many changes and make separate commits for the changes. It is also valuable to creating temporary changes that don't need to be committed, but still enable work that will be committed.
